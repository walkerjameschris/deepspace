## Perform Image Classification using a C++ Based Neural Network

A from-scratch implementation of a neural network in C++ and R used
for image classification. Includes functionality for live streaming video
feeds. Designed for linux based systems (leverages the fswebcam package).
Originally designed as my project of ISYE 6740.
