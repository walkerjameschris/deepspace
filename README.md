###  Tools for Matrices and Machine Learning Models

## Introduction

This R package provides a consistent NumPy inspired API for working with
matrices in R. It contains the most common matrix operations and implementations
for many machine learning models designed to operate over R matrices.
**Disclaimer:** These algorithms are primarily implemented for educational
purposes and should not be used in production code. However, I think the
simplistic nature of this  package makes it easy to distill the mechanics of
these models while retaining the performance of C++.

| Model | Status |

## Getting Started

To get started simply install the package from GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/walkerjameschris/matr")
```

To train a model, load the package and data. The `fit_network()` function
accepts the training data and labels (one hot encoded) as matrices. You can tune
the number of hidden layer neurons (`neurons`) in addition to the learning rate
(`learn_rate`), the max number of iterations (`epoch`), and a random seed.

```r
data <- matr:::mnist

network <-
  matr::fit_network(
    X = data$X,
    Y = data$Y,
    neurons = 5,
    epoch = 1000,
    learn_rate = 0.0001
  )

predict(network)
```
